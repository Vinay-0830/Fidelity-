The integration logic has been designed to handle file processing with a clear and robust approach, ensuring compliance with specific business requirements. Initially, the integration verifies whether the expected file exists. If the file is missing, the process is immediately stopped, and an error message is generated to notify CTG, ensuring no further processing occurs in the absence of a required file.

Next, the integration identifies the current day of the week and determines whether it is a weekday (Tuesday to Saturday) or Sunday. This step is essential to apply the appropriate logic based on the day, as the processing rules differ between weekdays and Sundays.

On weekdays, the integration expects the file to contain data. If the file is empty, the process is halted, and CTG is notified of the issue. This ensures that data is consistently available for processing during weekdays, and any discrepancies are promptly addressed.

For Sunday processing, the integration follows a different approach. If the file is empty, it logs an error message but does not stop the process. Instead, it marks the process as completed with errors, aligning with the business requirement to allow Sunday reconciliation to proceed, even if no data is present in the file.

If the file is present and contains valid data, the integration proceeds with its normal processing. This ensures that valid files are handled seamlessly, without interruption. The integration logic is designed to provide clear feedback and notifications, enabling the CTG team to monitor and resolve issues effectively while maintaining data integrity and adhering to the unique requirements for weekday and Sunday processing.



To accommodate the unique Sunday-specific logic for inbound file processing in Workday, the header of the file can be modified to include an identifier that differentiates Sunday reconciliation files from regular weekday files. The existing header format, H|<Identifier>|<Date>, can be adapted to include a unique suffix or marker for Sunday files. For instance, a weekday file could retain the standard format, such as H|INT397|JUL 2024, while Sunday files could use a modified header, such as H|INT397-SUN|JUL 2024. The inclusion of -SUN or a similar identifier explicitly distinguishes Sunday files, allowing the integration to apply specific processing rules for these cases.

During file processing, the integration will parse the header row to identify the file type. If the header indicates a weekday file, the integration will enforce weekday-specific rules, such as ensuring the file contains data. If the header denotes a Sunday file, the integration will trigger Sunday-specific logic, allowing the process to complete even if the file is empty but marking it as completed with errors while logging the issue. In scenarios where the header is missing or does not follow the expected format, the process will be aborted, and CTG will be notified for further investigation.

This approach simplifies the integration logic by embedding the file type directly within the header, making the file self-descriptive and reducing reliance on external factors such as system dates. It also enhances error handling by enabling clear identification of file type mismatches or issues during processing. By ensuring upstream systems consistently generate files with the correct header format, this solution provides a robust and scalable method to manage Sunday reconciliation logic alongside weekday processing.



We can also have the option of changing the naming conventions of files, where weekday files follow a standard format, and Sunday files include a unique identifier to distinguish them. This approach allows the integration process to identify Sunday files during validation and apply specific logic tailored to them, while the standard logic remains applicable for weekday files. Such a method ensures clarity, enhances processing efficiency, and supports streamlined validation workflows.
