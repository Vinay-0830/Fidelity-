    <h1 title="Why to learn Java Programming?">Why to learn Java Programming?</h1>
    <p title="introduction" class="introduction">Java is a must for students and working professionals to become 
        a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Sotware Development domain.
        I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Java Programming.</p>
        <dl  >
            <dd  ><strong class="reasons" >Object Oriented</strong>
<p class="description01">Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.</p></dd>

                Platform Independent
            </strong>
            <p>Unlike may other programming languages including C and C++ when java is compiled not compiled into 
                platform specific machine,rather into platform independent byte codes .
                This write-once, run-anywhere capability allows Java programs to be easily distributed and executed across different platforms without the need for recompilation
              </p>

                Simple
            </strong>
            <p>
                Java is beginner-friendly and one of the most popular programming languages among new developers. It has a syntax similar to English and enables you to write, debug, compile, and learn java programming fast.

            <dd>
                <strong class="reasons">Secure</strong>
                <p>
                    Java is secure due to the following reasons:
Java programs run inside a virtual machine which is known as a sandbox.
Java does not support explicit pointer.
                </p>
            </dd>
            <dd>
                <strong class="reasons">Architecture-neutral</strong>
                <p>ava is considered architecture neutral due to its ability to compile code into an intermediate representation called bytecode, 
                    which can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>
            </dd>
            <dd><strong class="reasons">Portable</strong>
            <p>Java is considered portable because of its “write once, run anywhere” principle, which allows Java code to be compiled into platform-independent
                 bytecode that can be executed on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). </p></dd>
        <dd>
            <strong class="reasons">Robust</strong><p class="description07">
                Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situaions by emphasising mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.
